Hello readers! Thank you so much for visiting my page! My name is Traci and I am a small town Iowa girl who relocated to Colorado for my husband’s job  a couple of years ago. Not only did we move across the country 3 months after we got married, but shortly after moving we found out we were pregnant, and we welcomed our son in June 2017 and we recently added another little boy in February 2019! Life has been a whirlwind, but it has been great. Everyone has different experiences, expectations, and stories about daily life, and I look forward to sharing my thoughts on big life changes, adding babies to the mix, and my cooking style with you.  My family always jokes that I don’t need any measuring devices because I’m more of a dump, pour, and splash kind of girl – BUT I am going to try really really hard for all of you so you can recreate if you so choose.

I also have my doctorate in physical therapy, and although I don’t always practice what I preach  I would be happy to answer questions as appropriate, and I will share some of my favorite exercises as well as I try to bounce back from postpartum life.
