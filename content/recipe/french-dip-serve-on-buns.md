  title: French Dip (Serve on Buns)
  description: Meaty, cheesy, onion-y goodness on a bun
  recipeIngredient:
    - 1.5-2 pound beef roast
    - 2 tbsp olive oil extra virgin
    - 1 tsp ground black pepper
    - 1 tsp seasoned salt
    - 1 tsp cayenne pepper
    - 1 tsp garlic salt
    - 1 tsp ground mustard
    - 1 tsp red pepper flakes
    - 1 tsp ground thyme
    - 2 cups hot water
    - 1 pkg onion soup mix
    - 6 rolls hoagie
    - 12 slices provolone cheese
    - 1 cup onion thinly silced
    - 1/2 cup fresh mushrooms sliced
    - 1/2 cup red pepper mayo see recipe below
  recipeInstructions:
    - Apply olive oil generously to outside of roast. Coat with your seasoning
      mixture (feel free to ad lib here with flavors you enjoy).
    - Sear roast in a skillet on all sides 30-60 seconds until a nice brown
      crust forms.
    - Place your 2 cups of hot water and the onion soup mix into the crock pot.
      Transfer browned roast to crock pot.
    - "Cook on low 4-6 hours or high 2-3 hours. NOTE: check the temperature
      often if able - you do not want to overcook your roast. For a medium
      roast, take it out when at 135 deg and let it rest until 145 deg. Thinly
      slice the roast against the grain OR pull apart with fork."
    - In a skillet over medium heat, caramelize onions and mushrooms in 2 Tbsp
      of butter. Once finished, place a serving of meat with a serving of the
      vegetables and cover with a piece of cheese. When cheese is melted,
      transfer to your hoagie.
    - For an added twist I use a red pepper mayo on the sandwich. It adds a nice
      kick of sweetness. (see recipe above)
    - Your au jus should be waiting for you in the bottom of the crock pot! No
      additional work needed for this. Indulge and enjoy!

Happy Tuesday everyone! We survived Monday, and now that it is over I can say that it wasn’t that bad after all. Before I jump into the details behind the mouth watering pictures below, I’ll give you the short and sweet version of the how and why of Midwest Mash.

Colorado newbie and Iowa native. Those are the basics. My husband got his dream job out here in Boulder so we jumped ship from West Des Moines and planted roots here in the beautiful foothills about a month ago. We also recently got married on May 21, so we have had a wild ride the past few months – wedding, honeymoon (Turks and Caicos – I highly recommend), job quitting, job getting, selling house, sleeping on air mattresses, and fitting 1700 sq ft of ~~crap~~ *totally necessary things* into a 2 bedroom apartment.  I am a physical therapist waiting semi-patiently on my lovely license to get transferred, so in the meantime I am grateful to finally be able to spend time doing things that I have neglected since graduate school such as writing and cooking. Commuting 2 hours every day for work the past two years left me with gobs of time to day dream about cooking and exercising but very little time for the actual execution unless you count doing kegels and glut squeezes in the car while reaching for a bag of Chex Mix. Bear with me while I brush off the cobwebs on the writing and cooking fronts.

So my husband really wanted this blog to be called “Serve on Buns” so this first post is an ode to him. Plus, who doesn’t love a juicy, cheesy, makes your house smell like a restaurant, French Dip sandwich? We are lucky enough to get our beef directly from my grandparents’ farm in Nebraska which in my opinion always wins against store bought. The only downfall is having to blindly pick a roast from a stack of white paper lumps in the freezer. The odds were in my favor today because I picked an excellent, low fat hunk of meat. I’ll be honest, all it said was “roast” on it, so I have no idea what type of roast this is, but really, any kind will do for this recipe. You can even use sirloin steak if that’s all you have on hand.
