Sorry for the week long hiatus! I really have no wonderful reason behind it besides being on the job search and to be quite honest, not feeling the inspiration bug for recipes last week. Sometimes you just don’t feel it. I did try out a few recipes last week though that weren’t blog worthy, but definitely will be in the future with a little tweaking (coming soon: Mexican fried rice and Thai peanut noodles).

My husband and I made our first trip back to the Midwest this last weekend to celebrate our niece’s second birthday. She had sooo much fun, and it’s awesome to see them get excited about every little thing. She got this My Little Pony – the purple one – and apparently it can fly on the TV show so she went around throwing it up in the air. Haha, it was ridiculously cute.  We had a great time, but coming back to Boulder made me realize that Colorado is kind of starting to feel like home as bittersweet as that is.

When we got back to our apartment, I looked at my counter and saw 4 mushy, brown bananas which might gross some people out but to me it screamed “time for something bread-y”! Usually banana bread it my go-to but this time I was feeling something a little different, and I was craving peanut butter. MMMM, you really can’t go wrong with chocolate and peanut butter. Plus you get to pretend these are healthy because they have bananas in them.
