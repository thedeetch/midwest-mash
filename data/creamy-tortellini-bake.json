    "1 can tomatoes (diced)",

    "1 Tbsp Italian seasoning",
    "1 pkg tortellini",

  "recipeInstructions": [
    "Bring tomatoes and tomato paste to a simmer. Add water to take it to the consistency you desire (I like mine on the thick side)",
    "Cook tortellini according to package instructions. DO NOT OVERCOOK. Just a little hint - you really don't need to stir while they are cooking, and most usually take 2-3 minutes tops. ",
    "In the bottom of a casserole dish (I recommend a rectangular one), spread 1/4 cup of your tomato sauce then layer 1/2 of the tortellini followed by more tomato sauce and a layer of mozzarella cubes.",
    "Before adding the second layer of tortellini, mix the cream and parmesan in a bowl and pour over the first layer. ",
    "Repeat layers, using the rest of your ingredients and finishing off the top with the cubed mozzarella. ",
    "Cook at 400 degrees for 25-30 minutes or until mozzarella begins to brown. ",
    "Serve with a sprinkle of Italian seasoning. Enjoy!"
